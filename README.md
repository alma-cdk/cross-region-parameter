**Store SSM Parameter into another AWS Region with CDK**



<br/>

## Important

**ðŸš§ This tool is work-in-progress and experimental!**

All `@almamedia-open-source/cdk-` prefixed constructs/utilities are based on existing CDK constructs/utilities we've developed & used (in production) internally at [Alma Media](https://www.almamedia.fi/en/) since 2019.

_Breaking changes may occur at any given time without prior warning before first `v1` major is released_, as we rewrite them for CDK v2 and use this opportunity to also redesign & refactor.

[Feedback](https://github.com/almamedia-open-source/cdk-cross-region-parameter/issues) is most welcome, but do note that we intend to implement these new constructs/utilities and their APIs in such manner that our existing CDK v1 production workloads can easily migrate into these new `@almamedia-open-source/cdk-` constructs/utilities.

<br/>
